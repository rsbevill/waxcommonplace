My name is Scott Bevill, and I'm a Visiting Instructor in English at the University of South Florida. This is a digital library of student work built using Wax. 

This collection contains work from my students in LIT 2000 at USF from Fall 2018, Spring 2019, and Fall 2019. One of the major assignments in my course is a commonplace book--a record of reading responses, quotes, and connections over a 6-week period of our course readings. I really enjoy reading through the final products from my students, but they are always have some questions about what their commonplace book should look like at the end of the project. This library contains a handful of sample commonplace books--both digital and analog--from students who have given me permission to share their work. Because I return many of these books to students at the end of the semester, I don't always have sample versions of the assignment available to show them. By digitizing the physical objects and linking to the digital journals in a single digital library, I will provide my students with access to a corpus of sample works that will make their lives easier. 

I have blocked out their full names from the image archive and have only credited them by their first name in an effort to continue protecting their anonymity as this library is published to the web.
